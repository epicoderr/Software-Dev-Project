# Purpose:
To build a program that plays the game minesweeper

# Planned features:
- Interface where you start
- Ability to play minesweeper

# Core functionality:
The core is clearly going to be the minesweeper game itself. I guess the core functionality of that would be the ability to generate a new, solvable puzzle each time a player chooses to play. You can split that into even more functionalities, like generating the placements of the bombs and the tiles around them. Making sure that the board is tracked accurately and that the player is able to clearly see everything will also be crucial.

# Extension Ideas:
- Making it look nicer
- Maybe adding a button that gives an explanation of how to play
- Adding difficulty choices
- Adding different versions of minesweeper
